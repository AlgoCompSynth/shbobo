## using
go into your directory, like _lin, _mac, or _win, and 
double click on Fish. Alternatively you can execute jish.jar
by double clicking on it (if you're perfectly lucky) or 
going to this directory in console and type:
```
java -jar jish.jar
```
that is, if you have [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed.
