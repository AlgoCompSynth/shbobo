## programs
 go into your OS-apprpriate directory, such as _lin, _mac, or _win, 
 and execute the following programs.
### shlisp
Shlisp is a command line to program your shnth or shtar.
it now has full language support, including barebones
lisp interpreter on host side for scripting and generative 
patch algorithms. like the olde program Galaxy for the DX7.

### fish 
double click on Fish. open a file from examp/shnth or
examp/shtar. try "serving" it to the device.

### justints(too)
for these two programs, have the shnth or shtar already 
plugged in with a USB cord. You can use the keystroke
"command-o" to open an example in examp/justints

## jish
is a new version of fish, in java. this is the future.
it calls the appropriate shlisp command line from _win,
_lin, or _mac. You can run the jish.jar
by double clicking on it (if you're perfectly lucky) or 
going to this directory in console and type:
```
java -jar jish.jar
```
that is, if you have [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed.



## sorce

Shmat is the source code for the st32f103rct6 chip inside shnth
and shtar.
